These are some of the same tools that the LIGO and Virgo collaborations use to find gravitational waves in LIGO/Virgo data \n",

In reality our noise is not entirely Gaussian, and in practice we use a variety of techniques to separate signals from noise in addition to the use of the matched filter. \n",

This cross-correlation walking through the data is a convolution operation. Convolution operations are more optimally performed in the frequency domain, which becomes a `O(N ln N)` operation, as opposed to the `O(N^2)` operation shown here. You can also conveniently vary the phase of the signal in the frequency domain, as we will illustrate in the next tutorial. PyCBC implements a frequency-domain matched-filtering engine. Let's move to the next tutorial now, where we will demonstrate its use on real data."
